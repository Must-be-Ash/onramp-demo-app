# IMPORTANT: Domain Configuration Required
# ==========================================
# For embedded wallets and onramp to work, you MUST configure your domains in CDP Portal:
#
# 1. Embedded Wallets CORS Configuration:
#    - Go to: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/embedded-wallets/cors
#    - Add your domain (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for local development)
#    - Add your production domain (e.g., https://your-domain.com)
#
# 2. Onramp Domain Configuration:
#    - Go to: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/onramp
#    - Add your domain (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for local development)
#    - Add your production domain (e.g., https://your-domain.com)
#
# Without proper domain configuration, both embedded wallets and onramp will fail to work.
